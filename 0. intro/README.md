## What is Docker
### As a developer
Amazon: https://aws.amazon.com/docker/  
Reproducable, lightweight containers that allows applications to think they're home alone.  
Move from "it works on my machine" to "it works in the container".  

### As a sysadmin
Similar to VMs, but OS layer is shared.  
Deploy applications without any bare metal dependencies.
